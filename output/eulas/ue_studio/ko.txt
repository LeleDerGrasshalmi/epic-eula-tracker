Please read this Agreement carefully.  It is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations related to your use of the Unreal® Studio and related content.  By downloading or using this software or any related content, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.  If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, please do not download or use this software or any related content.  

Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement.  Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 22.

If your primary residence (or primary place of business, if you are a legal entity like a corporation or an academic institution) is in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games, Inc.  If it is not in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games International S.à r.l., acting through its Swiss branch.  

If you are separately licensed by Epic under a Custom License, certain terms of this Agreement do not apply to your Custom Products.  Those terms are described below in Section 23. 

<EULA.Header>1. License Grants</>

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as described in this Agreement) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Engine Technology for any lawful purpose (the “<EULA.Highlight>Engine License</>”).  However, the rights that Epic grants you under the Engine License are subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may only make use of the Engine License if you comply with all applicable terms.

The Engine License does not grant you any title or ownership in the Engine Technology.

<EULA.Header>(A) Allowed forms of Distribution and Sublicensing</>

You may Distribute any product made using the Licensed Technology without restriction, so long as that product does not include any Engine Code (including as modified by you under the Engine License) and does not require any Engine Code (including as modified by you under the Engine License) to run.

Certain restrictions apply to Distribution of the Engine Technology, and consequently to the Distribution of a product developed under this Agreement that (i) combines any Engine Code with any other software or content, regardless of how much or little of the Engine Code is used, or (ii) relies on or requires any Engine Code to run (a “<EULA.Highlight>Studio Product</>”).

Specifically, you may only Distribute the Engine Technology as follows:

	<EULA.SubHeader>a. Distributions to Related Entities</> - You may Distribute the Engine Technology incorporated in object code (such as an application in executable form) format only as an inseparable part of a Studio Product to your Related Entities pursuant to a license agreement that is no less protective of Epic and the Engine Technology than this Agreement. The license agreement may authorize the Related Entity to use, reproduce, display and publicly perform the Studio Product. However, unless the Studio Product is an Exempt Product under Section 1(A)(c), you must ensure that the Related Entity does not Distribute the Studio Product. The Studio Product may not contain any Paid Content Distributed in uncooked source format or any Engine Tools.

	<EULA.SubHeader>b. Distribution to Clients</> - You may Distribute the Engine Technology incorporated in object code (such as an application in executable form) format only as an inseparable part of a Studio Product to a single third party for which you specifically developed the Studio Product in exchange for consultation fees or work-for-hire fees (including fees paid on a time and materials basis) (a “Client”). Prior to such Distribution, the Client must be subject to a license agreement that is no less protective of Epic and the Engine Technology than this Agreement. The license agreement may authorize the Client and its Related Entities to use, reproduce, display and publicly perform the Studio Product. However, unless the Studio Product is an Exempt Product under Section 1(A)(c), you must ensure that the Client and its Related Entities do not Distribute the Studio Product.  The Studio Product may not contain any Paid Content Distributed in uncooked source format or any Engine Tools.

	<EULA.SubHeader>c. Distribution in Exempt Products</> – You may Distribute the Engine Technology incorporated in object code (such as an application in executable form) format only as an inseparable part of an Exempt Product to end users pursuant to an end user license agreement that is no less protective of Epic and the Engine Technology than this Agreement. An “<EULA.Highlight>Exempt Product</>” is any Studio Product that (i) is not sold and not otherwise used to directly generate revenues or (ii) is entirely linear/non-interactive (e.g., a movie or animated cartoon). The Exempt Product may not contain any Paid Content Distributed in uncooked source format or any Engine Tools.

	<EULA.SubHeader>d. Distribution to other licensees</> - You may Distribute Engine Code (including as modified by you under the Engine License) in Source Code or object code format, or any Content, to an Engine Licensee who has rights under its license to the same Version of the Engine Code or Content that you are Distributing.  

	Any public Distribution (i.e., intended for Engine Licensees generally) which includes Engine Tools (including as modified by you under the Engine License) must take place either through the Marketplace (e.g., for distributing a Studio Product’s modding tool or editor to end users) or through a fork of Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network (e.g., for distributing Source Code). 

	<EULA.SubHeader>e. Distributions to employees and contractors</> - You also may Distribute Content (other than Paid Plug-ins) to an Engine Licensee who is your employee or your contractor who does not have rights under their license to the same Content, but only to permit that Engine Licensee to utilize that Content in good faith to develop a Studio Product or other product created under the Epic Licenses on your behalf for Distribution by you under the Epic Licenses, and not for the purpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of Content that is not permitted under this Agreement.  Recipients of such a Distribution have a limited license to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify that Content to develop your Studio Product as outlined above, and for no other purpose. 

	<EULA.SubHeader>f. Distribution of Paid Plug-ins</> - You may Distribute Paid Plug-ins to each of your Paid Plug-in Users so that they may use those Paid Plug-ins on your behalf under the Engine License. 

	<EULA.SubHeader>g. Distribution and sublicensing of Examples</> - You may Distribute or sublicense Examples (including as modified by you under the License) in Source Code or object code format to any third party.  However, the rights in this Section 1(A)(g) do not expand or modify your limited Distribution and sublicensing rights for Engine Code and Content (including as modified by you under the Engine License) that are not Examples. 

	<EULA.SubHeader>h. Distribution of Non-C++ Programming Language Integration</> - You may Distribute an integration of a programming language other than C++ for the Engine Technology, but if you do, the integration must be Distributed free of charge to all Engine Licensees, must be available in Source Code form (including, but not limited to, any compiler, linker, toolchain, and runtime), and must permit Distribution free of charge, on all platforms, in any Studio Product.

You are permitted to post snippets of Engine Code, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in public forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet, or distribute such snippets in connection with supporting patches and plug-ins for the Engine Technology, so long as it is not for the purpose of enabling non-Engine Licensees to use or modify any Engine Code, or to aggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the Engine Code.

You may not sublicense the Engine Technology in Source Code format. You may not sublicense the Engine Technology in object code format, or any Content, except to grant Related Parties, Clients, or end users the ability to use a Studio Product as permitted in Section 1(A), or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute an Exempt Product as permitted in Section 1(A)(c) above.  This paragraph does not limit your rights to Distribute and sublicense Examples. Any other Distribution or sublicensing of Engine Technology is permitted only if and to the extent authorized under an Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement and/or a Custom License you may have with Epic.

<EULA.Header>(B) Other Restrictions on Engine Technology</>

<EULA.HighlightItalic>(i) UE-Only Content</>

For UE-Only Content, you may exercise your rights under the Engine License only if and to the extent that the UE-Only Content is utilized in combination with the Engine Code.  For example, you may not develop or Distribute a Studio Product that consists of or contains UE-Only Content but does not contain and require the Engine Code (including as modified by you under the Engine License) for its use.  The UE-Only Content is subject to all of the terms of this Agreement that apply to Content, as well as the additional limitations described in this paragraph.  All references in this paragraph to UE-Only Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the Engine License.

<EULA.HighlightItalic>(ii) Non-Compatible Licenses</>

You may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Engine Technology with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Engine Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement (“<EULA.Highlight>Non-Compatible License</>”).  Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are prohibited:  GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.  Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are allowed:  BSD License, MIT License, Microsoft Public License, or Apache License.  You may not sublicense the Engine Technology under a Non-Compatible License.

<EULA.Header>(C) Datasmith and DIF Exporter Plug-in</>

<EULA.HighlightItalic>(i) Datasmith License</>

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license for a single User to use and reproduce Datasmith for the sole purpose of importing data from third-party applications into Unreal® Engine (the “<EULA.Highlight>Datasmith License</>”). However, the rights that Epic grants you under the Datasmith License are subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may only make use of the Datasmith License if you comply with all applicable terms. The Datasmith License does not grant you any title or ownership in Datasmith, or any right to access or receive any Source Code of Datasmith.

<EULA.HighlightItalic>(ii) DIF Exporter Plug-in License</>

Epic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license for a single User to use and reproduce each DIF Exporter Plug-in with the third-party application for which Epic has specifically designated the DIF Exporter Plug-in to be used, for the sole purpose of exporting and converting data from such third party application into the Datasmith Intermediate Format for you to import into Unreal® Engine (the “<EULA.Highlight>DIF Exporter Plug-in License</>”).  However, the rights that Epic grants you under the DIF Exporter Plug-in License are subject to the terms of this Agreement, and you may only make use of the DIF Exporter Plug-in License if you comply with all applicable terms. The DIF Exporter Plug-in License does not grant you any title or ownership in any DIF Exporter Plug-in, or any right to access or receive any Source Code of DIF Exporter Plug-ins.

<EULA.Header>(iii) Restrictions</>

You will not, and will not permit or encourage any third party to: (a) Distribute, display, or modify Datasmith or DIF Exporter Plug-ins, (b) attempt to circumvent, modify, or otherwise interfere with any technical measures designed to prevent unauthorized use of Datasmith or DIF Exporter Plug-ins, (c) use Datasmith or DIF Exporter Plug-ins to export, import, or convert data as a service for a third party (except to make a Studio Product or other product for a third party as permitted under this Agreement), (d) use Datasmith or DIF Exporter Plug-ins for software-as-a-service, hosted service, time-sharing, service bureau or similar use, or (e) disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer Datasmith or DIF Exporter Plug-ins, or otherwise attempt to discover the Source Code of Datasmith or DIF Exporter Plug-ins (or the underlying ideas, methods, algorithms, structure, or organization of Datasmith or DIF Exporter Plug-ins). The restriction in the foregoing clause (e) is inapplicable to the extent prohibited by applicable law; provided that, in the event you intend to disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer Datasmith or DIF Exporter Plug-ins or perform other activities described in clause (e), you will first provide Epic with written notice thereof. 

<EULA.Header>(D) Other Restrictions on Licensed Technology</>

You may not engage in any activity with respect to the Licensed Technology, including as incorporated into a Studio Product (1) for any gambling-related activities or Studio Products (as defined by law in the jurisdiction of use); (2) for operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems or air traffic control machines, or for military use in connection with live combat; (3) in violation of any applicable law or regulation; (4) that misappropriates any of Epic’s other products or services; (5) in support of a claim by you or any third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent.  You also may not sell or grant a security interest in the Licensed Technology.

<EULA.Header>2. User License</>

The Licensed Technology is licensed to you for use by a single User (other than Paid Plug-ins, which may also be used by your Paid Plug-in Users as described below).  The User may store the Licensed Technology on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except as part of a permitted Distribution of Engine Technology as described above.  

In order to access and download the Engine Code, Content, Datasmith, and DIF Exporter Plug-ins, you must set up an Account.  You may not share or allow others to use your Account.  You are responsible for the security of your Account.  For questions regarding your Account, please go to unrealengine.com/contact.

Under the Epic Licenses, the User may use the Licensed Technology for as long as you comply with this Agreement.  If you are a legal entity, references to “<EULA.Highlight>you</>” in this agreement also apply to the User in all cases.  You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this Agreement.

For Paid Plug-ins, in addition to use by a single User, each Paid Plug-in User with respect to whom you have paid the associated fee may store the Paid Plug-in on any of the Paid Plug-in User’s computers and may use the Paid Plug-in on your behalf under the Engine License, but the Paid Plug-in cannot be otherwise shared with others except as part of a permitted Distribution of Engine Technology as described above. You are responsible for each Paid Plug-in User’s compliance with this Agreement.

<EULA.Header>3. New Versions and Content</>

Subject to Section 19, during the term of this Agreement, you will be entitled to access future Versions of the Engine Code, Datasmith, and DIF Exporter Plug-Ins, and new Content and DIF Exporter Plug-Ins, that Epic chooses to make available to you.  Epic does not have any obligation to make these available.  Nor does Epic have any obligation to continue to make available for access or download any or all Versions of the Engine Code, Content, Datasmith, or DIF Exporter Plug-ins.  However, any Versions of the Engine Code, Content, Datasmith, and DIF Exporter Plug-ins that Epic has made available to you, and for which you have accepted any applicable amendment to this Agreement as described in Section 19, are considered part of the Licensed Technology and may be used under the Epic Licenses (as amended by that amendment).

<EULA.Header>4. Paid Content</>

Epic may make Paid Content available to you for a fee.  Your Engine License to Paid Content is subject to your payment of the associated fee.  In addition, your Paid Plug-in Users’ use of any Paid Plug-in under the Engine License is subject to your payment of the associated fee for each Paid Plug-in User for that Paid Plug-in.  When you pay the fee to obtain Paid Content, you are purchasing from Epic the right to have your Engine License include that Paid Content. 

Regardless of any references Epic may make outside this Agreement to purchasing or selling Paid Content, Paid Content is licensed, not sold, to you under the Engine License.  

When you provide payment information to Epic or its authorized processor, you represent that you are an authorized user of the payment card, PIN, key, account, or other payment method specified by you, and you authorize Epic to charge such payment method for the full amount of the transaction. 

From time to time, Epic may display links to Third Party Licensor Content on the Marketplace.  Epic does not license or provide Third Party Licensor Content to you under this Agreement.  Any use of Third Party Licensor Content requires you to enter into a separate license agreement directly with the provider of the Third Party Licensor Content.  The terms of your license agreement with the provider of the Third Party Licensor Content will govern all matters related to your use of Third Party Licensor Content rather than the terms of this Agreement.  

<EULA.Header>5. Support</>

Epic does not have any support obligations with respect to the Licensed Technology under this Agreement.  Support resources may be obtained at <a id="url" href="https://unrealengine.com/faq" style="EULA.Hyperlink">unrealengine.com/faq</>.

<EULA.Header>6. Feedback and Contributions</>

If you provide Epic with any Feedback, Epic is free to use the Feedback however it chooses.  If you make any Contribution available to Epic, you hereby assign to Epic all right, title, and interest (including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights) in that Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country.  If any of those rights are not effectively assigned under applicable law, you hereby grant Epic a non-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and make derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit that Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country.  If any of those rights may not be assigned or licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert all of those rights.  However, you may continue to freely use any Feedback that you provide to Epic, and you may continue to use, in any manner consistent with the Engine License, any Contribution that is a modification of Engine Technology that you make available to Epic.

You understand and agree that Epic is not required to make any use of any Feedback or Contribution that you provide.  You agree that if Epic makes use of your Feedback or Contribution, Epic is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.
You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that you provide to Epic to grant Epic and other affected parties the rights described above.  This includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights.

<EULA.Header>7. Third Party Software</>

The Engine Code and DIF Exporter Plug-ins include Third Party Software components.  If Third Party Software has separate software license or attribution requirements, the license terms or other attribution requirements for Third Party Software components can be found in the installation directory for each engine version (under the /Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Licenses sub-folder) or at <a id="url" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/studio/downloads" style="EULA.Hyperlink">https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/studio/downloads</> for DIF Exporter Plug-ins.  By entering into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those licenses.  In this case, the Third Party Software terms will govern your use of the Third Party Software, and if there is inconsistency, those terms will take precedence over the terms of the Engine License for the Third Party Software.  You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software.

<EULA.Header>8. Ownership</>

Epic or its licensors own all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the Engine Code, Content, Datasmith, and DIF Exporter Plug-ins.  You own all rights in the Studio Products or other products you develop under the Epic Licenses, other than the Engine Code, Content Datasmith, DIF Exporter Plug-ins, Third Party Software, and any Contributions. You also own all rights in any converted data resulting from your use of Datasmith or a DIF Exporter Plug-in (other than any Epic or third party rights in the underlying data that you converted). All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by the terms of this Agreement.  No license or other rights will be created hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.  Any attempted sublicense under this Agreement that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void.

<EULA.Header>9. Proprietary Notices and Attribution</>

You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Licensed Technology the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Epic and third parties as they appear in the Engine Code, Content, Datasmith, and DIF Exporter Plug-ins.

You agree to place the following notices in the credits (replacing xxxx with the current year) for any product you develop under the Epic Licenses, including but not limited to Studio Products, to the extent such product has credits:

“<EULA.Highlight>[Product name] uses the Unreal® Engine.  Unreal® is a trademark or registered trademark of Epic Games, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere</>”

“<EULA.Highlight>Unreal® Engine, Copyright 1998 – xxxx, Epic Games, Inc.  All rights reserved.</>”

No other license or right in the Epic Trademarks is granted under this Agreement.  All use of the Epic Trademarks will inure to the sole benefit of Epic.  You agree not to engage in any activity that could tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the Epic Trademarks or cause consumer confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to any Epic Trademarks.  If you wish to make further use of the Epic Trademarks, please go to <a id="url" href="https://www.unrealengine.com/branding-guidelines-and-trademark-usage" style="EULA.Hyperlink">https://www.unrealengine.com/branding-guidelines-and-trademark-usage</>.

<EULA.Header>10. Hardware and Usage Data</>

You acknowledge that, as a default setting, the Engine Code will collect and send to Epic anonymous hardware and usage data from users of Studio Products.  This functionality is used by Epic to improve the Engine Code.  You may modify the Engine Code under the Engine License to turn off that functionality in your Studio Product, or you may include in your Studio Product the capability for your users to turn off that functionality in the Studio Product.

<EULA.Header>11. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</>

<EULA.Header>The Licensed Technology, the Marketplace, and all other materials and information provided by Epic (the “<EULA.Highlight>Epic Materials</>”) are provided on an “<EULA.Highlight>as is</>” and “<EULA.Highlight>as available</>” basis, “<EULA.Highlight>with all faults</>” and without warranty of any kind.  Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Epic Materials, including without limitation all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of that purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates make no warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials will operate properly, including as integrated in any Studio Product or other product created under the Epic Licenses, (2) that the Epic Materials will meet your requirements, (3) that the operation of the Epic Materials will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, (4) that any defects in the Epic Materials can or will be corrected, (5) that the Epic Materials are or will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or (6) that a platform manufacturer will approve any of your Studio Products or other products created under the Epic Licenses, or will not revoke approval of any Studio Product or other product created under the Epic Licenses for any or no reason.  Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed.  Epic, its licensors, and its and their affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Epic Materials.  This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. </>

<EULA.Header>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Epic, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Epic’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Epic Materials or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.  In no event will Epic, its licensors, nor its or their affiliates, nor any of Epic’s service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Epic Materials, or the delay or inability to use or lack of functionality of the Epic Materials, even in the event of Epic’s or its Affiliates’ fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if Epic or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages.  These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.</>

<EULA.Header>Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in those states or jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to the full extent permitted by law. </>

<EULA.Header>12. Indemnity</>

You agree to indemnify, pay the defense costs of, and hold Epic, its licensors, its and their affiliates, and its and their employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and other representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert witnesses’ fees) that arise from or in connection with (a) any claim that, if true, would constitute a breach by you of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any Distribution or sublicensing of the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement) or negligence by you, (b) any claim brought by any third party to whom you Distribute or sublicense the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement (including without limitation any claim that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent), (c) any claim that any Studio Product or any other product or matter you created, or your exercise of the Epic Licenses, infringes any third party’s intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights (except to the extent of any claim that your authorized use of unmodified Licensed Technology originally provided to you by Epic under this Agreement infringes any United States patent, trademark or copyright), or (d) any federal, state, or foreign civil or criminal actions related to any Studio Product or other product you created under the Epic Licenses.  You agree to reimburse Epic on demand for any defense costs incurred by Epic and any payments made or loss suffered by Epic, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 12.

If you are prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation above, then you assume, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs and expert witnesses’ fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation above.  

<EULA.Header>13. Export Compliance</> 

You agree to comply with all applicable federal and foreign laws, regulations, and rules, and complete any required undertakings.  You will obtain any necessary export license or other governmental approval prior to accessing, downloading, exporting, re-exporting, or releasing the Licensed Technology.

For Custom Products, the terms of your applicable Custom License will govern all matters (including royalties, license fees, notifications, Feedback, Contributions, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, screen shots, and video content related to those Custom Products) related to your use of the code, artwork, and content that are licensed to you under that Custom License, instead of the terms of this Agreement.  

You may exercise your rights in Paid Content under the Engine License in connection with Custom Products that are developed and Distributed under your Custom License as if they were Studio Products developed and Distributed under the Engine License.  However, your exercise of those rights in connection with Custom Products is governed by and subject to the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation all obligations and limitations that apply to use of Paid Content in connection with Studio Products, as well as all disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnification rights of Epic, whether related to Paid Content, Studio Products, or otherwise.

<EULA.Header>24. Miscellaneous</>

This Agreement and any document or information referred to in this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between you and Epic relating to the subject matter covered by this Agreement.  All other communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the subject matter covered by this Agreement are excluded. However, for clarity, this Agreement does not supersede or amend any Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement or Custom License you may have with Epic, which will continue to govern the copy of Unreal® Engine and related content you may have obtained or obtain in the future under such agreement. If you obtained a DIF Exporter Plug-in accompanied by a different Epic license agreement for that DIF Exporter Plug-in, unless that license agreement expressly states that it controls over this Agreement, that license agreement will not apply and only this Agreement will govern your use of that DIF Exporter Plug-in. 

The original of this Agreement is in English; any translations are provided for reference purposes only.  You waive any right you may have under the law of your country to have this Agreement written or construed in the language of any other country.

This Agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your jurisdiction. This Agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction if the laws of your jurisdiction do not permit it to do so. Limitations and exclusions of warranties and remedies in this Agreement may not apply to you because your jurisdiction may not allow them in your particular circumstance.  In the event that certain provisions of this Agreement are not enforceable in your jurisdiction, those provisions shall be enforceable to the furthest extent possible under applicable law.

Any act by Epic to exercise, or failure or delay in exercise of, any of its rights under this Agreement, at law or in equity will not be deemed a waiver of those or any other rights or remedies available in contract, at law or in equity.

Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, if any term of this Agreement is held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the term will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  You agree that this Agreement does not confer any rights or remedies on any person other than the parties to this Agreement, except as expressly stated.

Epic’s obligations are subject to existing laws and legal process, and Epic may comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests or requirements despite any contrary term in this Agreement.
