# EPIC GAMES STORE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT      
This Epic Games Store Distribution Agreement and any of its riders, exhibits or addenda are all referred to as the “**Agreement.**” This Agreement is between the developer or publishing entity that clicks “Accept” below (“**you**,” “**your**,” or “**yours**”) and Epic Games, Inc., a Maryland, U.S.A. corporation with offices at 620 Crossroads Blvd., Cary, North Carolina 27518 (“**Epic**,” “**we**,” “**ours**,” or “**us**”) and is effective as of the date and time you click “Accept.” Sometimes in this Agreement, we talk about rules that apply to both of you and Epic; in these sections we refer to you or Epic individually as a “**Party**,” and you and Epic together as the “**Parties**.”        

The Agreement sets out the terms and requirements for you to list and sell the Digital Rights to your Product(s) on the Epic Games Store, including the obligations that you have to Epic and that Epic has to you.      

## 1.	PRODUCT LICENSE GRANT    

a. **Product License Grant to Epic**. Epic needs your permission in the form of a license to distribute your Product. You grant Epic a license to the Product that allows us to:        

 - i.	**Copy the Product** (e.g., to facilitate Users’ Product downloads after purchase)                            
 - ii.	**Display the Product** (e.g., to show your Product to consumers on the Epic Games Store in screenshots and videos)           
 - iii. **Distribute the Product** (e.g., to provide access to your Product to Users who have purchased the Digital Rights)          
 - iv.	**Perform the Product** (e.g., demonstrate your Product to Users)          
 - v.	**Use the Product** (e.g., to verify Product compliance with this Agreement)             

b.	**Restrictions on Epic’s License to the Product**. The license you grant to Epic for the Product is restricted as follows:                   

 - i.	**Limited Territory**: Epic can only exercise its license in the territories you choose to distribute your Product as selected by you in your Developer Portal.                  
 - ii.	**Perpetual Duration**: Epic’s license will continue until the Agreement is terminated; after that, the license still continues, but only so Users who have already purchased the Product can re-download the Product (unless that User’s license is terminated by you, Epic, or the User).                    
 - iii.	**Sublicensable**: Epic can sublicense portions of this license only as necessary to exercise its rights in this Agreement (like to our Affiliates and subsidiaries that deliver the Epic Games Store to Users or to Users who buy Digital Rights in a Product).                  
 - iv.	**No Other Payments**: Epic pays you amounts described in Section 7, but we do not owe you any other payments under this agreement.              
 - v.	**Limited Purpose**: Epic can only exercise the Product license rights you grant us to promote, market, and provide access to the Product to Users and to operate, promote, market, and support the Epic Games Store.                  
 - vi.**Discretionary**: Epic is not obligated to host your listing(s) for or to market or advertise your Product, and once you have listed your Product, Epic has no obligation to continue to host the Product’s display pages on the Epic Games Store or in any individual region where the Epic Games Store is offered. Once your Product is launched, Epic may remove or suspend listing(s) of your Product, but only after we take reasonable steps to provide you with written notice.                    

c.	**Restrictions on Users’ Digital Rights in a Product**. Users who purchase Digital Rights to your Product will be subject to the terms of Your EULA, but if you do not provide us with a EULA to include with your Product listing, then such use will be subject to the terms of the [Epic Games Store EULA](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/eula); and, in either case, use will be restricted as follows:        

 - i.	**Perpetual Duration**: Users’ Product license will only terminate if:               
      - a.	Epic terminates a User’s Epic Games account for violation of our terms or policies;                 
      - b.	You terminate a User’s license to a Product according to Your EULA; or              
      - c.	A User chooses to terminate their agreements with Epic or you.                
 - ii.	**Limited Territory**: Users may only purchase your Product in the territories you choose to distribute your Product as selected by you in your Developer Portal. After this initial purchase, Users may download and use the Product worldwide.        
 - iii.	**Limited License**: Each User who purchases Digital Rights to a Product may download, install, and use the Product for personal use subject to the terms of Your EULA or the Epic Games Store EULA.                
 - iv.	Your EULA must be consistent with this Agreement and the Epic Game Store EULA. If any term of Your EULA for a Product conflicts with any term of this Agreement or the Epic Game Store EULA, this Agreement or the Epic Game Store EULA, as applicable, will control.             
	
d.	**Your Product is Yours**. Apart from the limited license you grant Epic in this Section and Epic’s rights in its Product Distribution Tools, we have no rights under this Agreement from you or your licensors in any Product you submit. Your EULA is solely between you and the User, and Epic shall not be responsible for, and shall have no liability under, Your EULA. Our distribution of your Product is not a sale of the Product itself – it is a sale of license rights in the Product on the terms in this Section 1 (“**Digital Rights**”).           

e.	**Additional or Alternative Terms**. Additional or alternative terms relating to a specific Product may be included in a Product Addendum to this Agreement. If the terms of this Agreement and a Product Addendum are inconsistent, the terms of the Product Addendum will control for that Product.         


## 2.	PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION TOOLS          

a.	**Product Distribution Tools**. Epic has sample code and utilities it makes available to its partners in its “**Developer Portal**” that facilitate the distribution of the Product on the Epic Games Store (“**Product Distribution Tools**”). The Developer Portal itself is part of the Product Distribution Tools. Epic Online Services (<https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services>) and other standalone Epic products like Unreal Engine are not Product Distribution Tools and are not licensed to you under this Agreement.       

b.	**Product Distribution Tools License Grant**. You need permission in the form of a license to use the Product Distribution Tools. Epic grants you a license to the Product Distribution Tools that allows you to do the following:        

 - i.	**Copy the Product Distribution Tools**: You may copy the Product Distribution Tools executables for internal use by your team as long as every person on your team who receives a copy of the executables is bound by written terms at least as protective of Epic and the Product Distribution Tools as the terms in this Agreement.           
 - ii.	**Use the Product Distribution Tools**: You and your internal team may use and access the Product Distribution Tools so long as every person on your team who uses or access the Product Distribution Tools is bound by written terms at least as protective of Epic and the Product Distribution Tools as the terms in this Agreement.           
 - iii.	**Modify the Product Distribution Tool’s Source Code**: If Product Distribution Tools are provided to you in source code format or you have access to sample code implementing the Product Distribution Tools, you may modify that source code or sample code, solely for use in distributing your Product on the Epic Games Store.           
 - iv.	**Incorporate Parts of the Product Distribution Tools into the Product**: You may incorporate in your Product(s) the parts of the Product Distribution Tools that Epic specifically designates for incorporation into the Product.          

c.	**Restrictions on Your License to Product Distribution Tools**. You may not use the Product Distribution Tools for any purpose other than distributing your Product on the Epic Games Store as described in Section 2(b) above. If you breach the terms of this Agreement, we may limit, restrict, or rescind access to the Product Distribution Tools.         

d.	**Updates to the Product Distribution Tools**. From time to time, we may update the Product Distribution Tools. While you may not be required to use the newest version of the Product Distribution Tools, please note that when using older versions of the Product Distribution Tools you may encounter compatibility issues with our services.        

e.	**Store Pages**. In addition to creating product display pages for Products, Epic may enable, and if so, you may create, display pages for applications that are not available for download or purchase on the Epic Games Store. All of the obligations and responsibilities that apply to Products and Submission Materials also apply to these landing pages.               


## 3.	MODS     

a. **Authorization to Accept and Distribute Mods**. If you choose, you can allow third-party developers who aren’t you to submit “**Mods**,” which are standalone or add-on modification of or for one of your Products for distribution through the Store. These third-party developers are called “**Mod Developers**.” If you allow Mod Developers to submit Mods for distribution on the Epic Games Store, you give us permission to:            

 - i.	Allow Mod Developers to submit Mods to Epic for distribution on the Epic Games Store; and          
 - ii.	Exercise the same Product rights detailed in Sections 1, 5, and 6 to display, promote, and provide access to Mods to Users.       

b.	**Mod Distribution**. Epic may (but is not required to) provide Users with access to Mods subject to the Epic Games Store EULA. Epic may (but is not required to) review Mods to ensure they comply with its current policies for Mods. Epic isn’t responsible to you or any third party for Mods, including their development, review, or distribution. If you want to sell Digital Rights for Mods to Users through the Epic Games Store, you and Epic will agree upon the terms of sale of those Digital Rights to a Mod.       

c.	**Mod Submission**. For each Mod submitted to Epic by a Mod Developer, you will:      

 - i.	Respond to any information requests from us about a given Mod;       
 - ii.	Upon our request, confirm a Mod is compatible with a given Product and the Epic Games Store;       
 - iii.	If you and Epic agree to allow Users to access Mods outside the Epic Games Store interface, you will provide clear notice to Users of Epic’s Mod reporting features; and          
 - iv.	Enter into an agreement with each Mod Developer that details the distribution of the Mod Developer’s Mods on the Epic Games Store.             
	
d. 	**Contacting Mod Developers**. Epic may provide you the contact information of Mod Developers subject to the terms of your Data Processing Agreement with Epic. For clarity, you will only communicate with Mod Developers using this information to facilitate and administer the distribution of a Mod Developer’s Mod on the Epic Games Store.       

e.	**Termination of the Agreement and Mods**. If this Agreement or a Product Addendum upon which a Mod is dependent for distribution is terminated, Digital Rights in those dependent Mods will be treated the same as the Digital Rights for the Mod’s related Product described in Section 10 below (e.g., Users retain their Digital Rights in Mods, will not be required to delete the Mod from their computers, and may re-download the Mod if they wish, and Epic will stop distributing Digital Rights in the Mod to new Users in a reasonable amount of time after termination).        

f.	**Removal of Mods**. Epic may, at any time, for any reason, remove a Mod from the Epic Games Store, provided we take reasonable steps to provide notice to the Mod Developer prior to the removal. Additionally, you may request that we remove any Mod for your Product from the Epic Games Store, and we will honor your request.         
         

## 4.	SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND EPIC/YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES     

a.	**Submission Requirements**. When you submit text, screenshots, videos, ratings information, disclosures, and other statements (all of these together, your “**Submission Materials**”) and your Product to us, you represent and warrant that:        

 - i.	**Multiplayer Game Products are PC Cross-Play Compatible**: Each multiplayer PC Product you submit to the Epic Games Store is cross-play compatible with all other PC versions of the title distributed through other PC storefronts. You can choose how to achieve this compatibility – for example, you may choose to build your own friends and matchmaking solution, you may choose to use Epic Online Services (<https://dev.epicgames.com/services>), or you may choose to use a different third-party solution.         
 - ii.	**PC Achievement Parity**: Each Product you submit to the Epic Games Store that contains achievements or a similar feature on another third-party PC storefront (like Steam, GOG.com, Itch.io, or the Microsoft Store), will have substantially similar achievements with your Product on such other PC storefronts.       
 - iii.	**Update Parity**: For each Product you make available on other PC stores or launchers, you will provide us updates for bug fixes, compatibility, and performance issues no later than you provide them elsewhere.

 - vi.	**The Product does not promote hatred, racism, or discrimination**: The product does not promote hatred, racism, or discrimination.           
 - vii.	**The Product Does Not Facilitate Gambling, Unlicensed Money Transmissions, or Unlawful Transactions**: Your Product does not facilitate gambling for real money or for a digital currency that can be directly redeemed for real money (e.g., cryptocurrency or digital currency that can be “cashed out” for real money or cryptocurrency), unlicensed money transmissions or banking, transactions with individuals or entities restricted by the United States or other governmental authority, or other unlawful commercial or other activities.             
 
 - viii.	**Submission Materials are Complete and Compliant**: You have given us complete and accurate Submission Materials, complete with all the warnings, disclosures, and information required by law to be displayed with your Product.

      - b.	**This obligation is ongoing**: If the Submission Materials you gave us are no longer accurate (for example, because you introduce new features or change your ratings information), you will update your Submission Materials so that they stay complete and current.              
 - ix.	**The Product Works on the Epic Games Store**: You have verified that your Product is compatible with the Epic Games Store and can be downloaded, installed, and executed successfully.           
      - a.	**This obligation is ongoing**: As long as your Product is available on the Epic Games Store, you will make reasonable efforts to make sure the Product remains compatible with the Epic Games Store. If your Product is not compatible with the Epic Games Store, we may temporarily suspend or restrict the availability of your Product on the Epic Games Store until you fix the compatibility issues. We’ll only do this after taking reasonable steps to notify you in writing.          
 - x.	**You Have Provided Any Additional Required Information**: You have provided us with all additional requested information we need to enable distribution of your Product on the Epic Games Store.              
 - xi.	**You Have All Necessary Rights in the Product and Submission Materials**: You have all of the intellectual property, publicity, and other third-party rights in the Product needed to distribute your Product and Submission Materials on the Epic Games Store.          
 - xii.	**Open Source and Copyleft Products Must Not Incorporate Product Distribution Tools**: Any Product(s) distributed under an open source, copyleft, or other similar license that would result in the source or sample code of Product Distribution Tools to be subject to the same license terms, does not incorporate the Product Distribution Tools’ source or sample code.        
 - xiii.	**No Adults Only (AO) Rated Products**: Your Product does not have an Adults Only (AO) rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB). The Epic Games Store does not allow Adults Only (AO) rated Products.       

b.	**Your Responsibilities**. As between you and Epic, you are solely responsible for:       

 - i.	**Product QA**: you’re responsible for performing industry standard quality assurance for the Product; and

We will provide you written notice that we have passed along your contact information unless we are prohibited from doing so by law.             


## 5.	USE OF BRAND FEATURES AND SUBMISSION MATERIALS        

a.	**Brand Features**. You and Epic each own or license trademarks, logos, and other brand features that are distinctive and unique (all of these together, we’ll call “**Brand Features**”). Between you and Epic, you own your Brand Features, and we own our Brand Features. Your and Epic’s only interest under this Agreement in the other’s Brand Features is the limited license below. The rest of this Section details when and how you and Epic may use each other’s Brand Features.         

b.	**Your Brand Features and Submission Materials License to Epic**. You grant Epic a license to your Brand Features and Submission Materials that allows us to:       

 - i.	**Use Your Brand Features and Submission Materials** (e.g., mentioning your Product and company name in one of our tweets);        
 - ii.	**Modify Your Brand Features and Submission Materials** (e.g., resizing a Product’s banner art to fit in a search results page);            
 - iii.	**Display Your Brand Features and Submission Materials** (e.g., showing your Product’s logo on its product display page).        

c.	**Restrictions on Epic’s Use of Your Brand Features**. The license you grant to Epic to your Brand Features and Submission Materials is restricted in the following ways:          

 - i.	**Non-Exclusive**: You may license your Brand Features and Submission Materials to anyone.      
 - ii.	**Modification Limited**: Epic may only modify your Brand Features and Submission Materials to make them consistent with the formatting and layout of the Epic Games Store. Epic may not materially alter your Brand Features or Submission Materials without your permission.         
 - iii.	**Use Limited**: Epic may only use your Brand Features and Submission Materials in exercising its rights under this Agreement, like marketing and distributing the Product. This use does include Epic’s ability to reference your Product’s title in newsletters, blogs, and genre/category pages on the Epic Games Store.          
 - iv.	**No Commingling or New Asset Creation**: Epic will not create new assets out of the Brand Features or Submission Materials you submit or commingle your Brand Features or Submission Materials in a single asset with the brand features of other partners on the Epic Games Store without your written permission.        

d.	**Epic’s Brand Features License to You**. While Epic does not require you to use our Brand Features, if you would like to use our Brand Features to promote your Product, Epic grants you a license to our Brand Features that allows you to:        

 - i.	**Use Our Brand Features** (e.g., mentioning that your Product is available on the Epic Games Store on a podcast);         
 - ii.	**Display Our Brand Features** (e.g., displaying the Epic Games Store Logo on a launch graphic for your Product);            
 - iii.	**Modify Our Brand Features** (e.g., resize our logo for inclusion on your Product packaging).           

e.	**Restrictions on Your Use of Epic’s Brand Features**. The license Epic grants to You to our Brand Features is restricted in the following ways:       
 
 - i.	**Non-Exclusive**: We may license our Brand Features to whoever we wish.        
 - ii.	**Modification Limited**: You may modify our Brand Features, but you must abide by our brand guidelines made available to you in writing on the Developer Portal.        
 - iii.	**Use Limited**: You may only use our Brand Features to market and promote your Product’s availability on the Epic Games Store. You may not use our Brand Features after termination of the Agreement, and you will cease use of our Brand Features at our request, if you do not abide by our brand guidelines or if you are in breach of this Agreement.        


## 6.	PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION AND REVENUE SHARE        

a.	**Epic Games Store Model and Sales Channels**. There are three primary ways that your Product may be distributed to Users: (i) direct sales through the Epic Games Store; (ii) keys; or (iii) keyless entitlements. The term “purchase” is used throughout this Agreement to describe when Users obtain Digital Rights in Products through any of these methods, even if the User does not make a payment in exchange for the Digital Rights. Under this Agreement, you sell Digital Rights through the Epic Games Store, and you can choose to distribute your Product via keys and/or keyless entitlements.          

 - i.	**Direct Sales through the Epic Games Store**: When you sell Digital Rights in a Product to Users via the Epic Games Store, the transaction is between you and the User. Each transaction that Epic or one of its payment processors receives payment through the store for one of your Products or any in-Product transaction is a “**Transaction**.” You will set and provide Epic with the price for Digital Rights in your Products as part of the Submission Materials (“**Listing Price**,”) and you instruct Epic to adjust the Listing Price to include Sales Tax for those jurisdictions that require listing prices to include Sales Tax.       

 - ii.	**Keys**: You can also enable purchases of Digital Rights in your Product by selling or giving away redeemable codes called keys. When a key is entered on the Epic Games Store, it grants Digital Rights to the User who redeemed the key. You can request that Epic issue you keys that you can then give away or sell for whatever price you wish. You don’t need to report revenue on the sale of Product keys to Epic and they aren’t subject to Epic’s 12% Revenue Share. Epic reserves the right to limit the size of your key grants to reasonably sized batches to prevent fraud and abuse. If your Product is built using the Unreal Engine, you may still owe Unreal Engine license royalties on revenue earned through keys-based Product distribution. Finally, as between you and Epic, you are responsible for taxes on distribution of a Product via keys.        

 - iii.	**Keyless Entitlements**: You can also distribute your Product via keyless entitlements. Keyless entitlements work like keys, so you can give away or sell Digital Rights via keyless entitlements for whatever price you wish, but distribution to Users occurs via an API so they don’t need to enter a code on the Epic Games Store. Keyless entitlement sales happen on third-party platforms that grant entitlements for Digital Rights to a User on the Epic Games Store in exchange for the User’s payment to the platform. Since keyless entitlements require platforms to use one of Epic’s APIs to facilitate granting Digital Rights, each of you and Epic need an agreement in place with each third-party platform you’d like to use for keyless entitlements. Like distribution of Product keys, you don’t need to report revenue on keyless entitlements you sell on a third party’s platform to Epic, and sales aren’t subject to Epic’s 12% Revenue Share. Also like the distribution of Product keys, if your Product is built using the Unreal Engine, you may still owe Unreal Engine license royalties on revenue earned through keyless entitlement Product distribution. Finally, as between you and Epic, you are responsible for taxes on distribution of a Product via keyless entitlements.          

b.	**Revenue Share**. When a User buys Digital Rights through the direct sales described in Section 6(a)(i) above, Epic collects their money and deducts any Sales Tax that it will remit to tax authorities. Epic pays you 88% of the price charged for a sale of Digital Rights, in each case after deducting Sales Tax and any Support-A-Creator Fee you choose to pay, and amounts attributable to payment processing fees, chargebacks, User refunds, discounts, and charges related to fraud. Epic keeps 12% plus any applicable deductions as the “**Revenue Share.**”        

c.	**Support-A-Creator**. Epic operates its Support-A-Creator Program to promote its partners’ products on the Epic Games Store. As part of this program, you may specify a percentage of the sales for a specified Product to pay influencers in the Support-A-Creator Program as a Support-A-Creator Fee for their promotion of your product to their online followings. This percentage is the “**SAC Percentage**.” The SAC Percentage is applied to the gross sales proceeds minus Sales Tax after deduction of returns, discounts, refunds, fraud, and chargebacks. The Support-A-Creator Fee, inclusive of its deduction calculations, can be viewed in your Sales Data.         

 - i.	**You can raise or lower the SAC Percentage**. You can raise or lower the SAC Percentage to increase or reduce the Support-A-Creator Fee. At times when Epic provides a subsidy to Support-A-Creator which is paid by Epic rather than you, you may not lower the SAC Percentage below the Epic subsidy.  As of October 2022, Epic is providing a 5% subsidy. If Epic changes the subsidy, Epic will take reasonable steps to notify you by email and include instructions on how to change your specified percentage.             

d.	**In-Product Purchases and Non-Epic Transactions**. While Epic operates its own payment solution available through the Epic Games Store, your Product can facilitate in-Product payment and transactions using a system other than Epic’s (“**Non-Epic Transactions**”) for your sale of digital items and services to your end users for use within the Product. However, your Product and Non-Epic Transactions must follow these rules:            

 - i.	**No gambling, unlicensed money transmissions, or unlawful transactions**. You may not facilitate gambling, unlicensed money transmissions or banking, transactions with individuals or entities restricted by the United States or other governmental authority, or facilitate or engage in  illegal commercial activities or other unlawful activities.             
 - ii.	**No blockchain, distributed ledger, or other decentralized currency activities without an appropriate rider to the Agreement**. The Product and Non-Epic Transactions cannot utilize cryptocurrency, blockchain, or other distributed ledger-based payment methods unless Epic reviews your use case and you and Epic enter into a blockchain rider to the Agreement.          
 - iii.	**Users must accept Your EULA**. You must require all end users who make Non-Epic Transactions to affirmatively accept Your EULA. Between you and Epic, you, and not Epic, are responsible for all Non-Epic Transactions.            
 - iv.	**You will need to collect and pay applicable taxes on Non-Epic Transactions**. If end users make Non-Epic Transactions or receive a Product entitlement through a method other than the direct sales described in Section 6(a)(i), then you will be obligated to collect taxes and remit that tax to the appropriate taxing authority. Epic is not responsible for taxes on Non-Epic Transactions or sale of Digital Rights via keys or keyless entitlements. As each developer’s tax situation is different, we recommend that you consult a tax professional for advice on tax liability to your business.           
 - v.	**You will implement and maintain industry standard practices and security**. You must implement and maintain industry-standard practices concerning payments, end user data, privacy, security, and user support for Non-Epic Transactions. You are solely responsible for all end user support, maintenance, and complaints related to Non-Epic Transactions.          
 - vi.	**Non-Epic Transactions subject to Unreal Engine royalty**. For clarity, Non-Epic Transaction revenue is subject to any applicable Unreal Engine royalty.   


## 7. PAYMENT PROCESSING, PAYMENTS TO YOU, TAXES       

a.	**Payment Processing**.  You designate Epic, and through Epic the third parties we designate, as your undisclosed agent solely for Transactions processed through the Epic Games Store.             

 - i.	**As your agent, Epic (directly or through third parties that we designate) will**:           
      - a.	collect all User payments for Transactions, including Sales Tax as described in Section 7(c); and       
      - b.	keep the Revenue Share and any applicable deductions as described in 7(b).        
 - ii.	**Additionally, Epic may**:       
      - a.	act as your payment processor for Transactions;        
      - b.	accept or decline to accept any form of payment from Users;         
      - c.	pause a Transaction for investigation;         
      - d.	refuse to process and/or cancel any Transaction (for example, due to concerns about potential fraud, customer payment issues, or some other potential breach of this Agreement);          
      - e.	have Epic’s (or its authorized payment processing services’) name appear on the User’s credit or other card statement;         
      - f.	address and resolve disputes related to Transactions between you and Users;          
      - g.	provide, or require you provide, refunds to Users according to our Refund Policy, available at <https://www.epicgames.com/site/store-refund-policy>; and

b.	**Payments to You**. Here’s what to expect with Epic’s payment process:

 - ii.	**Payout Minimum**: Generally, we only issue payment in amounts over $100. If you haven’t accrued $100 in amounts owed to you, we roll your earnings over monthly and pay you when you cross the $100 payment threshold. The two exceptions to this rule are: (1) we never withhold earnings for more than a year; and (2) we withhold payment for pre-purchases until Product Launch – details on pre-purchases are below.           
 - iii.	**Payments for Pre-Purchase Products Held Until Launch**: if you choose to make a Product available for pre-purchase, we only pay you for pre-purchases to you after the Product Launches on the Epic Games Store. If you remove a Product from pre-purchase or cancel its pre-purchase prior to Launch or if we are otherwise required by law, we refund Users their prepaid funds for the Product.         
 - iv.	**Bank Fees Deducted from Payment**. If we incur any wire transfer, bank, or payment fees, we may deduct those fees from our payment to you. We have no responsibility for any of these types of fees incurred by you.     
 
 c.	**Taxes**. You authorize Epic to act in its own name but on your behalf for Sales Tax purposes in connection with, the sale of Digital Rights in your Product on the Epic Games Store. Epic collects Sales Tax from Users and remits that Sales Tax to the relevant taxing authority for sales of Digital Rights that happen in the jurisdictions listed on our “**Tax Jurisdictions List**,”  accessible at https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/o/store/policies. The Tax Jurisdictions List is subject to change. If you or Epic are liable for Sales Tax in jurisdictions that are not in the Tax Jurisdictions List, we may deduct those taxes from future payment or collect those taxes directly from you.         
 - i.	You are responsible for the payment of all other taxes, including income taxes, levies, VAT, and similar fees, due on payments we make to you under this Agreement.         
 - ii.	In certain jurisdictions, tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report tax information about you, withhold taxes from payouts to you, or both. If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine is sufficient to fulfill our obligation to withhold taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until you provide us with sufficient documentation.           
 - iii.	If we have to withhold taxes on payments we make to you, we deduct those taxes from the amount owed to you and pay the proper tax authorities. We will give you a receipt for any of these withholding taxes and we’ll also provide you other documents you reasonably request so that you can claim foreign tax credits or refunds.           
 - iv.	Certain territories may not allow us to remit taxes on your behalf. You are obligated to remit taxes in these jurisdictions to the appropriate tax authority.         

d.	**Tax Forms**. We will need you to give us a completed Form W-9 (if you are based in the United States) or Form W-8BEN (if you are not based in the United States), bank account details, and other information for your tax onboarding so that we can pay you.

We will provide you with anonymized financial data on sales of Digital Rights for Products via Epic Games Store, including returns, discounts, refunds, fraudulent amounts, chargebacks, Sales Tax, processing fees, and Support-A-Creator Fees deductible under this Agreement (“**Sales Data**”).

If you are a current Unreal Engine licensee, regardless of what your Unreal Engine license agreement may say, you owe no Unreal Engine license royalties on revenue earned from your Product’s distribution on the Epic Games Store where User payment is processed using Epic’s payment service.            


## 8.	CONFIDENTIALITY        

a.	**Definition**. You and Epic each have information that is proprietary, confidential, or not generally known to the public. Sometimes, this information will be marked as confidential, and other times based on context it should reasonably be considered confidential. With respect to each party, this information is “**Confidential Information**.” Aggregated data that is not specific to you (e.g., total number of downloads of all Products on the Epic Games Store) is Epic’s Confidential Information, but excluding Personal Data as defined in the attached Data Processing Agreement (Exhibit A). Your Sales Data that is associated with you is your Confidential Information; however, any data that is aggregated or anonymized in a way such that its developer source or related Product information cannot reasonably be identified is our Confidential Information.          

b.	**Keep Confidential Information Confidential**. You and Epic may disclose Confidential Information to each other while working together under this Agreement. Each Party will protect the confidentiality of the other’s Confidential Information as if it was their own Confidential Information, and each party will only use the other’s Confidential Information to perform its obligations under this Agreement. As a general rule, neither Party will disclose the other’s Confidential Information to any third party. The exceptions to this rule are in Section 8(c) below.               

c.	**Disclosure of Confidential Information**. Except to the extent Confidential Information is also Personal Data (as defined in the DPA), a Party may disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information in the following cases:

      - a.	the recipient’s job duties justify their need to know the Confidential Information;           
      - b.	the recipient is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; and          
      - c.	the Party making the disclosure of the other’s Confidential Information is responsible for the recipient’s confidentiality obligations as if the recipient was a Party to this Agreement.             
 - ii.	**The Confidential Information is Publicly Available**. The Confidential Information is or becomes publicly available. A Party’s breach of their confidentiality obligations in this Section do not count as the other Party’s Confidential Information becoming publicly available.         
 - iii.	**Prior Knowledge**. A Party can disclose the other’s Confidential Information if they already knew the other’s Confidential Information before entering the Agreement and without a confidentiality obligation.         
 - iv.	**Third Party Disclosure**. A Party can disclose the other’s Confidential Information if they learn that Confidential Information from a third-party source that is not in known breach of a confidentiality obligation.        
 - v.	**Independent Development**. A Party can disclose the other’s Confidential Information if they independently develop that information without reliance on the other Party’s Confidential Information.           
 - vi.	**Government Request**. A Party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by a subpoena, court order, or other government request, if, as permitted by law:          
      - a.	They provide advance written notice to the other Party so that the other Party can object to the disclosure or seek a court order that protects their Confidential Information;
