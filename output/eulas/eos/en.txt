Epic has developed a set of online services for developers to use in their video games. Epic’s intent is to provide these services to you for use in your video games in the same manner and at the same level of quality as Epic expects for Epic’s own games. 

Epic is currently planning to offer two tiers of services: Live Services and Experimental Services. Live Services are stable Services that Epic intends to offer on a long-term basis. Experimental Services are early releases which are expected to change as Epic continues development and for which Epic is soliciting your feedback. Epic may add more tiers as it adds more Services.

Please read this Agreement carefully. It is a legal document that explains your rights and obligations related to your use of the SDK and related Services. You may only use these services if you comply with the terms of this Agreement. By downloading or using the SDK or accessing any Services or using the Developer Portal, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not download or use the SDK or any Services or use the Developer Portal.

Certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this Agreement. Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 11.

If your primary residence (or primary place of business, if you are a legal entity like a corporation or an academic institution) is in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games, Inc. If it is not in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games International S.à r.l., acting through its Swiss branch.

1                 PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT
</>
1.1             The purpose of this Agreement is to establish terms regarding your use of the SDK and related Services. The specific Services are set forth in the Service Addendum. This Agreement together with the Service Addendum constitutes one single agreement. 

<EULA.Header>
2                 SERVICES
</>
2.1             During the term of this Agreement, Epic will make available the Services identified in the Service Addendum.  Epic will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Services in substantially the same manner and level of quality that Epic provides with respect to services for its own games, taking into consideration whether such Services are Experimental Services or Live Services.  

2.2	Epic’s obligations under Section 2.1 are conditioned upon (a) your ongoing, good-faith cooperation to perform all tasks necessary, or reasonably requested by Epic, to integrate the SDK and ensure that your Video Games are compatible with the SDK and Services, and (b) your compliance with all applicable terms of this Agreement. 

2.3	If you do not use or access a particular Service for a period of one year or longer, upon thirty (30) days notice Epic may delete any data relating to such Service that is stored or maintained through the Service.

<EULA.Header>
3	SDK LICENSE
</>
3.1	During the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and subject to your compliance with such terms and conditions, Epic hereby grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, terminable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license only to:  (a) use the SDK to integrate Services with your Video Games; (b) integrate the Distributable Code in your Video Games for the sole purpose of accessing the Services; and (c) distribute the Distributable Code in object code format so integrated in your Video Games to end users who are subject to an end user license agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the SDK and the Services.  

3.2	You have the right to have third-party contractors practice, on your sole behalf, the license rights granted in Section 3.1. You will cause each such contractor to abide by all of your obligations hereunder as if it were a party to this Agreement. You are directly and primarily responsible and liable for any acts or omissions of each such contractor in relation to any subject matter of this Agreement. 

3.3	You agree that you have no rights in or to the SDK other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement.  

<EULA.Header>
4	LICENSE RESTRICTIONS AND ACCEPTABLE USE             
</>
4.1	You agree not to, and you will not permit any third party to: 

(a) access the Services except through the SDK, the Developer Portal, or as otherwise expressly authorized by Epic;

(b) use the SDK in connection with any applications or software other than Video Games;

(c) combine, distribute, or otherwise use the SDK with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the SDK be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement; or

(d) utilize the SDK or the Services 

(1) in any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation;
(2) to interfere with any third party’s access to the SDK or the Services, intentionally or otherwise; 
(3) to tamper with or circumvent technical restrictions on use, access, storage, or any function of the Services, for example by using access credentials you are not authorized to use; or
(4) in an unreasonable or excessive manner given the scope, nature, and content of your Video Game, for example to conduct a DDOS attack on the Services.

Epic intends to be transparent in its management and enforcement of the restrictions above. Epic will keep you up-to-date and provide additional guidance on these issues through the <a id="url" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/services/terms/aup" style="EULA.Hyperlink">EOS Acceptable Use Policy</>. In addition, technical documentation outlining how to use the SDK and the Services, including any technical restrictions on their use, is available on <a id="url" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs" style="EULA.Hyperlink">Epic’s documentation page</>.

4.2	Epic reserves the right to remove content stored or maintained through the Services or disable access to, suspend, or terminate the Services to comply with applicable law or if you are in violation of this Section 4. You agree to provide information or other materials related to your use of the Services as reasonably requested by Epic to investigate the source of any problem with the Services or to verify your compliance with this Agreement.

<EULA.Header>
5	UPDATES TO THE SDK; UPDATES TO THIS AGREEMENT
</>
5.1             Epic may release SDK Updates from time to time and make them available via the Developer Portal. Epic will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any Live Services are backwards compatible with Video Games that integrate prior versions of the SDK. 

5.2	Epic may discontinue support for any Live Service upon three (3) years’ written notice to you.

5.3.	Epic may discontinue support for or change any Experimental Service at any time upon prior written notice to you.

5.4	Epic may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion by providing notice to you or by providing you with digital access to the amended Agreement when you log in to the Developer Portal or download SDK Updates. You are not required to accept the amended Agreement. However, in order to use SDK Updates or access new Services that Epic offers, you must accept the amended Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Epic may amend this Agreement with respect to the current version of the SDK or the current Services to comply with law or regulatory requirements, in which case Epic will provide reasonable notice to you.

6                 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
</>
6.1             Epic and its licensors own and retain all rights, title, and interest including all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the SDK and the Services. All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by the terms of this Agreement.  No license or other rights will be created hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.  For the avoidance of doubt, all Intellectual Property Rights in the Distributable Code as integrated in your Video Game(s) shall remain the property of Epic.

6.3	You acknowledge and agree that you have no rights with respect to any trademarks, service marks, trade names, or logos of Epic or its Affiliates (the “Epic Trademarks”). If you wish to make use of Epic Trademarks, please go to <a id="url" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/branding" style="EULA.Hyperlink">dev.epicgames.com/branding</>.

6.4             Epic acknowledges and agrees that you (and your licensors, if any) solely own and retain all rights, title, and interest including all Intellectual Property Rights in and to your Video Game(s) (apart from any Distributable Code integrated therein). 

6.5             As used herein, “Feedback” means suggestions, comments, ideas, and all other types of information, including software and code, which (a) you give or communicate directly or indirectly (including your employees, agents, contractors, or representatives) to Epic or its agents; and (b) relates to the SDK, its components, any Services, or the Developer Portal.  You agree to grant and hereby grant to Epic a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, non-terminable, transferable, and assignable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, modify, and create derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit any and all Feedback for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country.  Any and all Feedback shall be subject to Epic’s underlying rights in the subject matter of such Feedback. You understand and agree that Epic is not required to make any use of any Feedback that you provide. You agree that if Epic makes use of your Feedback, Epic is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.  You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback that you provide to Epic to grant Epic and other affected parties the rights described above. This includes but is not limited to Intellectual Property Rights and other proprietary or personal rights.

6.6	The SDK includes third-party software components (“Third-Party Software”). If Third-Party Software has separate software license or attribution requirements, the license terms or other attribution requirements for Third-Party Software components will be provided in the ThirdPartyNotices folder of the SDK.  

<EULA.Header>
7                 NOTICES
</>
Where this Agreement calls for notice from Epic, including written notice, Epic may provide notice to you at the email address that you provided when you registered for the Services (or any updated email address you subsequently provide) or via notifications in the Developer Portal. If provided via email, Epic’s notices to you will be effective when they are sent to that email address. If provided via the Developer Portal, Epic’s notices to you will be effective seven (7) days following Epic’s notification on the Developer Portal.

8                 DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
</>
8.1             The SDK, the Services, the Developer Portal and all other materials and information provided by Epic (the “Epic Materials and Services”) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind. Epic, its licensors, and its and their Affiliates disclaim all warranties, conditions, common law duties, and representations (express, implied, oral, and written) with respect to the Epic Materials and Services, including all express, implied, and statutory warranties and conditions of any kind, such as title, non-interference with your enjoyment, authority, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness or suitability for any purpose (whether or not Epic knows or has reason to know of that purpose), system integration, accuracy or completeness, results, reasonable care, workmanlike effort, lack of negligence, and lack of viruses, whether alleged to arise under law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of dealing.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Epic, its licensors, and its and their Affiliates make no warranty that (1) any of the Epic Materials and Services will operate properly, (2) the Epic Materials and Services will meet your requirements, (3) the operation of the Epic Materials and Services will be uninterrupted, bug free, or error free in any or all circumstances, (4) any defects in the Epic Materials and Services can or will be corrected, (5) the Epic Materials and Services are or will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or (6) a platform manufacturer will approve any of your Video Games, or will not revoke approval of any Video Game for any or no reason. Any warranty against infringement that may be provided in Section 2-312 of the Uniform Commercial Code or in any other comparable statute is expressly disclaimed. Epic, its licensors, and its and their Affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Epic Materials and Services. This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

8.2             To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Epic, its licensors, nor its or their Affiliates, nor any of Epic’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Epic Materials and Services or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. In no event will Epic, its licensors, nor its or their Affiliates, nor any of Epic’s service providers be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Epic Materials and Services, or the delay or inability to use or lack of functionality of the Epic Materials and Services, even in the event of Epic’s or its Affiliates’ fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if Epic or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

8.3             Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in those states or jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to the full extent permitted by law.

9                 INDEMNIFICATION
</>
9.1             You agree to indemnify, pay the defense costs of, and hold Epic, its licensors, its and their Affiliates, and its and their employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and other representatives harmless from all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs, and expert witnesses’ fees) that arise from or in connection with (a) any claim that, if true, would constitute a breach by you of this Agreement or negligence by you, (b) any claim brought by any third party to whom you distribute or sublicense the SDK in violation of this Agreement (including any claim that the SDK infringes a patent), (c) any claim that any Video Game or any other matter you created, or your exercise of the licenses granted under this Agreement, infringes any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary or personal rights (except to the extent of any claim that your authorized use of the unmodified SDK originally provided to you by Epic under this Agreement infringes any United States patent, trademark or copyright), or (d) any federal, state, or foreign civil or criminal actions related to any Video Game. You agree to reimburse Epic on demand for any defense costs incurred by Epic and any payments made or loss suffered by Epic, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 9.

9.2             If you are prohibited by law from entering into the indemnification obligation above, then you assume, to the extent permitted by law, all liability for all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, costs and expert witnesses’ fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation above.
