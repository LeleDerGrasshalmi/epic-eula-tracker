# SERVICE ADDENDUM FOR ANTI-CHEAT SERVICES
LAST UPDATED 28th OF JUNE 2024

This Service Addendum for Anti-Cheat Services (“Addendum”) supplements the Epic Online Services Developer Agreement (“Developer Agreement”) between you and Epic. All defined terms used in the Developer Agreement will have the same meaning where used in this Addendum, unless this Addendum expressly states otherwise.

The Developer Agreement outlines the general terms regarding your use of the SDK and Services. The Developer Agreement together with any Service Addenda constitute one single agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this Addendum and the Developer Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Addendum will prevail.

## 1\. PURPOSE OF THIS ADDENDUM

The purpose of this Addendum is to set forth specific terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Anti-Cheat Services, which enables the functionality described below.

| Service | Description |
|	-----|----- |
| Anti-Cheat EOS SDK 1.14.x and earlier (Preview Service) | A service that helps you detect and/or prevent the use of cheats in your Video Game.  Anti-Cheat as implemented in EOS SDK 1.14.x and earlier is being maintained as a Preview Service. If you would like to use Anti-Cheat as a Live Service, use EOS SDK 1.15.x or later. |

## 2\. SERVICE-SPECIFIC TERMS

Epic makes no warranty, either express or implied, about the Anti-Cheat Services, including without limitation that the Anti-Cheat Services will be effective or will detect or mitigate any cheats.

Epic will use commercially reasonable efforts, in light of relevant circumstances such as the nature and features of, and demand for, the Video Game and applicable cheat technology, to provide the Anti-Cheat Services.  The foregoing sentence supersedes the language in Section 2.1 of the Developer Agreement solely with respect to the Anti-Cheat Services.  To preserve the integrity of the Anti-Cheat Services, Epic will not disclose to you any information that exposes confidential information relating to Epic’s cheat detection methods.
