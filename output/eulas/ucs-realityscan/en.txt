Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Licensor Parties make no warranty that (1) the Software will operate properly, (2) the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or free of bugs, errors, or malware (such as viruses), or (3) any defects in the Software can or will be corrected.

Further, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Licensor Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software will not exceed the greater of (A) the total amounts you have paid (if any) to Licensor for the particular Software to which the liability relates during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the events giving rise to such liability or (B) Five Hundred Dollars (USD $500). These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.</p>
    <p class="highlight">Notwithstanding the foregoing, some countries, states, provinces or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability as stated above, so the above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing exclusions and limitations shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in this Agreement will prejudice the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Software. To the extent any product warranty exists for the Software under applicable law that cannot be disclaimed, Licensor will be solely responsible for such warranty.</p>
